# Tic-Tac_Toe
This is game is the classic tic tac toe game. This game is made using basic python functions. To make it more interesting and dynamic , i have used some libraries like IPython.display (to clear the board after every chance) , random (to randomly choose the first turn) and Pyttsx3 (so that the system speaks out and greets the user to make the program more interesting).
In this game basically, two players (player 1 & player 2) are given their symbols (X or O) and then they simply play the tic tac toe game.
here's the layout of the board to make it easy for the user to understand the indexs:

1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
